AI Pathfinding

I would like to continue this project, and may update the project at
https://github.com/danielwiktorczyk/AI-Pathfinding
, my repo which I shall make public after the submission date. 

That being said, the project is NOT finished in this current state. 


I have completed the requirements for R1, and have the pathfinding working for the PoV nodes. 

There's some issues with the grid tiles when pathfinding, and my Astar isn't running very well either. 

Did not have time to add in character movement sadly ;(


Hope that helps! Thank you!
